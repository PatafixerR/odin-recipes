    <h2>As with many recipes, the origins of the dish and its name are obscure, 
        however, most sources trace its origin to the region of Lazio.</h2>

    <h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter.</li>
            <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced.</li>
            <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
            <li>3 to 4 whole eggs.</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese.</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>

    <h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
            <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. 
                Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan
                 and mix them together.</li>
            <li>Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with 
                a little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti
                 and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, 
                 covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
            <li>Squash 2 peeled plump garlic cloves with 
                the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.</li>
            <li>While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 
                Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, 
                as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.</li>
            <li>Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, 
                until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now imparted 
                its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.</li>
            <li>Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready,
                 lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in 
                 the frying pan with the pancetta. Dont worry if a little water drops in 
                 the pan as well (you want this to happen) and dont throw the pasta water away yet.</li>
            <li>Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small 
                handful back for sprinkling over later.</li>
            <li>Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. 
                Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork,
                lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, 
                which thickens but doesnt scramble, and everything is coated.</li>
            <li>Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy 
                (several tablespoons should do it). You don
                t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.</li>
